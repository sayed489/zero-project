When the user scrolls back up, the back panel should reappear. The images should stay centered and fixed in the viewport during the animation sequence.(using an Intersection Observer or simple scroll event listener) to achieve this 'scroll-to-reveal' effect. Ensure the animation is smooth and responsive.
